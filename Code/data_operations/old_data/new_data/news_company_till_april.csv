The crisis over its 737 Max jet could be even harder to manage, given the incalculable reputational risk after two fatal crashes. The struggle that the two Lion Air pilots waged with their out-of-control 737 Max 8 aircraft last October was both tenacious and terrifying. A new automated safety feature on the jet designed to prevent stalls instead kept sending the aircraft into a dive. Again and again, the pilots pulled the jet’s nose up, only to have a faulty sensor reverse their actions. For some reason, they couldn’t or didn’t cut off the automation, which ultimately sent the year-old Boeing jet into a steep dive and a crash that would claim 189 lives.  The deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines has led to a virtual worldwide grounding of the plane and raised urgent questions about why a brand-new aircraft would go down minutes after takeoff. BEIJING — Once known for its deadly skies, China doubled down on aviation safety as it grew in wealth and power. A new-model airliner crashes, killing all 189 people aboard.

Boeing Planes Are Grounded in U.S. After Days of Pressure After days of mounting pressure, the United States grounded Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft on Wednesday, reversing an earlier decision in which American regulators said the planes could keep flying after a deadly crash in Ethiopia. The American agency was the last major holdout as other countries grounded or banned Max planes from their airspace after the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash this weekend. Reporters for The New York Times rode on two Boeing 737 Max 8 flights. The scene was ordinary, despite some lingering qualms. Aboard a Max 8 Airplane: ‘I Didn’t Want to Say It and Get Anybody Nervous’ NORFOLK, Va. — It looked like any other Southwest Airlines flight: free pretzels, conspicuously cheery flight attendants, a mad dash for aisle seats. Reporters for The New York Times rode on two Boeing 737 Max 8 flights. The scene was ordinary, despite some lingering qualms. Travelers on American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines flights will be rebooked — or scheduled on different planes — if they were to fly on the Boeing aircraft. The short-term costs such are likely manageable for Boeing, but the bigger question is whether airlines lose confidence in the company’s best-selling jet. What to Know if Your Boeing 737 Max 8 Flight Was Canceled Boeing Works to Manage a Crisis With Unknown Costs Read more live coverage on the crash and its aftermath here. When Boeing’s Dreamliner was grounded in 2013, it took more than $20 million and three months to fix the problem. The crisis over its 737 Max jet could be even harder to manage, given the incalculable reputational risk after two fatal crashes. Travelers on American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines flights will be rebooked — or scheduled on different planes — if they were to fly on the Boeing aircraft. The short-term costs such are likely manageable for Boeing, but the bigger question is whether airlines lose confidence in the company’s best-selling jet. Why should the F.A.A. continue to permit a system prone to going haywire aboard an aircraft? Ground the Boeing Max 8. There Are Too Many Concerns. The struggle that the two Lion Air pilots waged with their out-of-control 737 Max 8 aircraft last October was both tenacious and terrifying. A new automated safety feature on the jet designed to prevent stalls instead kept sending the aircraft into a dive. Again and again, the pilots pulled the jet’s nose up, only to have a faulty sensor reverse their actions. For some reason, they couldn’t or didn’t cut off the automation, which ultimately sent the year-old Boeing jet into a steep dive and a crash that would claim 189 lives. Why should the F.A.A. continue to permit a system prone to going haywire aboard an aircraft? To the danger zone. The crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 has led much of the world to ground the popular plane and raised urgent questions about its safety. Boeing’s 737 Max Causes Concern A Simple Guide to the Aftermath of the Ethiopian Plane Crash  The deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines has led to a virtual worldwide grounding of the plane and raised urgent questions about why a brand-new aircraft would go down minutes after takeoff. To the danger zone. The crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 has led much of the world to ground the popular plane and raised urgent questions about its safety. The record of many airlines in China was once cause for concern. Now the country is seeking to compete with the United States and Europe in aerospace. Federal aviation regulators have allowed the airline industry to have too much power. China Asserts Its Air Safety Bona Fides After Boeing Crash The 737 Max Is Grounded, No Thanks to the F.A.A. BEIJING — Once known for its deadly skies, China doubled down on aviation safety as it grew in wealth and power. A new-model airliner crashes, killing all 189 people aboard. Less than five months later, another airliner of the same new model crashes, killing all 157 aboard. Both seem to have occurred under similar circumstances. The world was understandably terrified, and until Wednesday, the United States Federal Aviation Administration stood alone as the only major aviation safety agency that had not ordered the grounding of this airline model, Boeing’s 737 Max 8. The record of many airlines in China was once cause for concern. Now the country is seeking to compete with the United States and Europe in aerospace. Federal aviation regulators have allowed the airline industry to have too much power.

On Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 taxied toward the runway at the main airport in Jakarta, Indonesia, carrying 189 people bound for Bangka Island, a short flight away. The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeing’s largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots — most of them recent graduates of its own academy — and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilot’s seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte. On the coming run, it would be his turn to do the flying. Malfunctions caused two deadly crashes. But an industry that puts unprepared pilots in the cockpit is just as guilty."
